## About me

Hi! I’m **Zhou Yang (周旸)**, an undergraduate student (Class of **2023**) in **Computational Mathematics** at the **School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University**.

I build my work on a strong mathematical foundation and translate **analysis, algebra, and numerical methods** into **practical modeling and computation**. I enjoy turning abstract ideas into reproducible solutions—through coursework, mathematics competitions, mathematical modeling contests, and long-term research-style projects.

- **Email:** zhouyang0694@whu.edu.cn
- **Affiliation:** School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University  
- **Program:** Computational Mathematics (B.S. candidate)

## Academic performance

I value rigorous fundamentals and clear reasoning. Over the past two academic years, I achieved **full marks in 15 major courses**, which supported my further exploration in competitions and research-oriented training.

## Project experience

### Provincial Undergraduate Innovation Training Program (URTP)
**Theory and Computation of Rational Approximation**  
A year-long research-style project focusing on how rational approximations can be constructed and computed stably and efficiently.  
Through literature reading, theoretical derivations, numerical experiments, and code implementation, I learned to bridge “correct on paper” with “reproducible on a computer,” paying special attention to **applicability conditions, numerical stability, and error sources**.

## Teamwork in mathematical modeling

In modeling competitions, I often serve as the **modeling lead**:
- I quickly restate the problem, extract key variables, define objectives/constraints, and set assumptions.
- I design the modeling framework and outline solution procedures (including derivation and algorithmic flow).
- I collaborate tightly with:
  - the **programming lead** to align feasibility, complexity, data preprocessing, parameter definitions, and experiment design;
  - the **writing lead** to ensure the report has a coherent narrative—motivation, assumptions, method, results, and interpretation.

After each contest, I keep a structured checklist to review whether assumptions were too strong, where implementation was fragile, and which conclusions need stronger evidence (e.g., ablations or sensitivity analyses). This “replayable” workflow turns short-term performance into long-term transferable ability.

## A short note

I believe the charm of Computational Mathematics lies in this chain:
**describe the world with mathematics → approximate answers with computation → validate results with careful experiments**.
